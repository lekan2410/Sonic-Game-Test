# Sonic-Game-Test

This is a mini playground Sonic Game that I have created using Unity while also exploring 3D game development. 

# Warnings

* There is a collider problem where Sonic won't be able to jump after a little while due to a collider problem. To fix this, either restart the game or collide with the craters to get Sonic back to normal.

* Animations may be a bit wonky as it isn't perfect, so expect to see weird animations.

# How to Play
* W A S D to move
* Q to drift to the left (When on Ground)
* E to drift to the right (When on Ground)
* Q to use homing attack (When jumping or in the air)
* Space to Jump
* Hold Shift to boost
* C to Stomp (When in the air)
* Homing attack only works when near an enemy or object (Springs)
